## Potential attack vectors:
* one of the casino paths running out of gas?: Difference in cost for transferFrom and transfer? If transferFrom > transfer then a player could set gas amount to what is required to go on the winning streak and cause out of gas for the other path thus never loosing
* should not be an issue as running out of gas will keep the transaction cost from the player.
